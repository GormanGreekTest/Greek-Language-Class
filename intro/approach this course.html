Reading Greek in the Digital Age is designed to be a self-paced, open access course in Attic Greek.  
It employs tools that are freely available, and no textbook is required. 
The principal aim is to offer a reading knowledge of Greek, Latin, and, frankly, languages in general to anyone who has the desire to learn, without forcing the reader to go through a lengthy and unnecessary hazing period of extensive rote memorization of syntactic forms and vocabulary words that rarely, if ever, occur. </p>
<hr/>
<p>This course focuses on the text of Xenophon’s Hellenika.
  Because of its subject-matter, the main vocabulary is fairly limited to military terms.
  The structure is a straightforward narrative sprinkled with speeches, all of which provides an ideal pathway to learning to read Attic Greek.
 You will start with simplified sentences from the Hellenika and, as you progress through further grammatical elements, those same sentences will recur with the new elements restored in them, until you are able to read the unadulterated Greek text.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>You will be using two free digital tools.
  The first is Alpheios, a web browser extension that gives you the meaning and the morphological analysis of each word in your text.
 The second is Arethusa, a treebanking program available through the Perseids Project.
  It is used to make grammatical trees of the sentences, using the simple rules of Dependency Syntax.
  You will learn to read trees, in order to understand the grammatical structure of the sentences you are translating.
</p>
<hr/>
</ul>
<pBegin by going through the chapters in Unit 1, especially the general grammar files in English (Grammar 101-104).
  They lay out the language of language, parts of speech, and the basics of Dependency Syntax.
 Additional material introduces you to the Greek Alphabet.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Then proceed to Unit 2, The Simple Sentence.
 For each chapter, you should begin by watching the video lesson or lessons.
  You will find separate files containing the PowerPoint used in that lesson, as well as a handout or two with most commonly occurring forms and any useful ancillary data.
  Often web links will follow, especially links to the pertinent sections of Smyth’s Greek Grammar.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Once you have explored the lesson, you should proceed to the practice sentences.
 At the moment, you will find separate files for the sentences themselves (in html and in Word), a commentary, and a translation.
  If you open the html file, the Alpheios tool is embedded within it.
 As you click on each word that you do not know, the Alpheios toolbar provides its definition and morphological analysis (go to Alpheios.
net for a short tutorial on using the tool bar).
 You can use the Commentary file to get hints to the grammatical and semantic structures.
  The Translation file offers renderings of the sentences in idiomatic English.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Practice with as few or as many of the sentences in each chapter as you like.
  Typically you will find several hundred sentences that are original to the Hellenika or else modified from it, deleting structures to which you have not yet been introduced or changing the vocabulary slightly.
  The sentences are divided into two sections.
  Common Vocabulary uses only those words the occurs most frequently and are presented to you in the handouts.
  Some New Vocabulary” contains just that: most of the words should look familiar, but some new words are added in as well.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>If the short definition offered initially by Alpheios does not seem appropriate for your context, feel free to click on the symbol on the toolbar that takes you to the default dictionary and a wider range of commonly-used definitions.
  You should set your default Greek dictionary to the Middle Liddell for the time being.
  The tutorials on the Alpheios web site show you how to do so.</p>
  <hr/>
  </ul>
  <p>There is an additional tree file for each chapter.
  Soon they will be embedded in the html file that you use with Alpheios.
  Until then, you can upload the tree files into Perseids in order to see the grammatical structure of each sentence laid out very clearly according to the simple rules of dependency syntax.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>For the time being, in order to view the completed trees, download the separate tree file.
  Use Gmail or a similar account to log into the Perseids project (https://www.
perseids.
org/perseids-platform).
 Go to the New Treebank Annotation button at the top of the page.
  Use the button at the bottom of the next page to upload the file from your hard drive.
  Click Edit.
  Wait a few seconds, until the list of sentences appears before you.
  You may at that moment rename the file using the Change Title button near the top right.
 Click on each sentence individually and explore.<p/>
 <hr/>
 <p>If you wish to try your hand at constructing your own trees, download the sentences in Word, strip the sentence numbers out of them, log-in to Perseids, click on the top button  labeled New Treebank Annotation, cut-and-paste the sentences into the Input Text Box, and click on Edit.  In a few seconds, you should have the list of sentences in front of you, ready for manipulation.</p>
