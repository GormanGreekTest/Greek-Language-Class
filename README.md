This repositiory contains a self-paced, open access class titled Reading Ancient Greek in the Digital Age.  
The premise of this class is that it is not necessary, or even desireable, to memorize thousands of paradigm forms and vocabulary words that you will rarely see.
Instead, you will learn the metalanguage of language, so that you can talk about language.  You will learn Dependency Syntax as a means to analyze the original texts.
You will be given the most commonly occuring forms and vocabulary, so that your efforts are time- and labor-efficient.
You will be taught to use the modern tools that are freely availably, especially Alpheios, a web browser extension that offers morphological analysis and definitions, and Arethusa on the Perseids website, where dependency syntax trees are constructed and available for autopsy.
